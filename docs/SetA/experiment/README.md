## About

The anagram experiment is a series of experiments looking at the cognitive processes involved with time etimation and time prospection.

### on Anagrammer

Anagrammer is the name of the first in those experiments to gather statistics on the time it takes for people to solve a series of shuffled word strings. The data of which will be used for the next sets of experiments.

### Structure of this Repository

* In experiment is the files for the current experiment "anagramer"
 Within the experiment folder is jspsych java scripts operating as a kind of spine from which the experiment pulls and runs.
    **core_js *:
    This is a subset of javascripts from the Js Psych library
    ** css **:
    A subset of CSS stylings, html, and javascripts from Js Psych and Bran
    ** Stimuli **:
    Not explicitly necessary for the anagrammer functioning, this contains the python notebook and csv of shuffled words used in the experiment as a backup.
    ** Other files
Finally the other files inside experiment are liscence and this readme
