As a young, healthy volunteer, you have been asked to participate in this study because our objective is to understand the cognitive functions supported by the healthy human brain. You will be asked to verify that you are between 18-50 years of age. You will be asked to attend to stimuli presented from a computer (usually visual or auditory) and then make a response (usually with hands or with saccadic eye movements) based upon the stimuli.</p>",
          "<p><i>You will be asked to make responses in one or more of the following conditions:</i></p><p> 1. Respond based upon your preferences between different presented options.</p><p> 2. Respond as quickly and accurately as possible to stimuli that are presented in succession.</p><p> 3. Learn a set of stimuli and later respond based upon your memory of the stimuli that you learned.</p><p> As your participation in the experiment is voluntary, you are free to discontinue the experiment at any point. At the discretion of the protocol director subjects may be taken out of this study due to unanticipated circumstances.</p><p><i> Some possible reasons for withdrawal are:</i></p><p> - failure to follow instructions</p><p>- the investigator decides that continuation would be harmful to you </p><p>-the study is canceled</p><p>-not meeting inclusion criteria</p>",
          "<p><b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b></p><p> Your participation in this experiment will take approximately 30-60minutes. Longer studies will be broken up across multiple study sessions. The specific length of the study that you will be completing will be in your study description.</p><p><b> RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b></p><p>There are no known risks associated with participation in this study. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.</p><p><b>PAYMENTS:</b></p><p> As compensation for your participation, you will be paid at the rate listed on prolific at the end of the testing session.</p><p> There is no cost to you for this study.</p><p> There may be the potential to earn bonus pay based upon performance, or completion of the entire group of tasks. </p>",
          "<p><b>PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS:</b></p><p> If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate. </p><p> You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals.</p><p> Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study. Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you.",
